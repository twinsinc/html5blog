		<h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE BACK END</h3>
		<p class="entry">The backend usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. If you book a flight or buy concert tickets, you usually open a website and interact with the frontend. Once you’ve entered that information, the application stores it in a database that was created on a server. For sake of ease, just think about a database as a giant Excel spreadsheet on your computer, but your computer (server) is stored somewhere in Arizona.

		All of that information stays on the server so when you log back into the application to print your tickets, all of the information is still there in your account.

		We call a person that builds all of this technology to work together a backend developer. Backend technologies usually consist of languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. To make them even easier to use they’re usually enhanced by frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Cake PHP, and Code Igniter that all make development faster and easier to collaborate on.</p>

		<h3>WHAT IS RUBY?</h3>
		<p class="entry">Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto" title="Wikipedia">Yukihiro Matsumoto</a>, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

		He has often said that he is <em>“trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,”</em> in a way that mirrors life.

		Building on this, he adds:
		<blockquote>
		<p>Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>WHERE TO START WIRH RUBY</h3>
		<p class="entry">This is a small Ruby tutorial that should take no more than 20 minutes to complete. It makes the assumption that you already have Ruby installed. (If you do not have Ruby on your computer install it before you get started.) <br>

	<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with less stress.</p>
